# ⚡ EV Vehicle Charge Demand Forecasting

This project is a part of the **AICTE Internship - July 2025**, focusing on the **prediction of Electric Vehicle (EV) charging demand** using data preprocessing, forecasting models, and visualization techniques.

## 📌 Week 1 Overview

- Explored and cleaned the dataset `Electric_Vehicle_Population_By_County.csv`
- Identified useful features like `Model Year`, `Make`, `Electric Vehicle Type`, and `County`
- Performed basic data preprocessing and transformation
- Conducted exploratory data analysis (EDA) and visualization

## 📌 Week 2 Objectives

- Loaded and preprocessed the dataset again using improved logic
- Trained a forecasting model using `LinearRegression` to predict future EV counts
- Saved the model using `pickle` (`forecasting_ev_model.pkl`)
- Saved the cleaned dataset as `preprocessed_ev_data.csv`
- Prepared the notebook for submission
